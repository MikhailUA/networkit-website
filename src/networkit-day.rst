We are happy to announce that **NetworKit Day** will be held on **October 15,
2020** via zoom.
The goal of this day is to both present NetworKit to people who don’t know it
yet and to update more seasoned users and developers about the new
features, which have grown quite a bit over the last years. Also, in this
meeting we wish to discuss future development directions and receive feedback
on the current status of NetworKit.

Registration is mandatory to attend, so do not forget to
`register (free of charge) by October 13th
<https://www.eventbrite.de/e/networkit-day-2020-nd20-registration-121199776795>`_.

**Preliminary program (all times in CEST)**:

.. raw:: latex html

  <ul>
    <li>11:30am - 11:45am : Welcome and introduction (Henning Meyerhenke, HU Berlin)</li>
    <li>11:45am - 12:15pm : Tutorial for new users (Eugenio Angriman, HU Berlin)</li>
    <li>12:15pm - 12:45pm : Scientific Talk: "Integrating NetworKit into a web-based Environment for Network Analysis and Exploration" (Jörn Kreutel, Beuth Hochschule für Technik Berlin)</li>
    <ul>
        <li><u>Abstract:</u> The talk will present a web based platform for network analysis in the digital humanities that is being developed as a work in progress and uses NetworKit as its core analysis engine. The architecture of the platform will be outlined, and we will demonstrate some exploration functions that enhance networks with additional data related to its constituting entities.</li>
    </ul>
  </ul>

LUNCH BREAK

  <ul>
    <li>1:30pm - 2:00pm : Scientific Talk: "On Mining Distances out of Massive Time-Evolving Graphs"
  (Mattia D'Emidio, University of L’Aquila, Italy)</li>
    <ul>
        <li><u>Abstract:</u> Computing shortest-path distances is a fundamental primitive in the context of graph mining, since this kind of information is essential to a broad range of prominent application domains, including among others network analysis, data routing, web search optimization, and route planning. <br><button type="button" class="btn-link collapsed"></button><div class="collapse"> Textbook approaches for shortest paths (e.g. executing Dijkstra’s algorithm or precomputing a distance matrix) do not scale well with the graph’ size, as they either take seconds to answer a single query on the distance or have a huge memory footprint, when the graph has millions of vertices/arcs. Therefore, to achieve faster query answering and affordable space requirements, smarter and more scalable methods have been designed, the most practical of them being based on a compact representation of the transitive closure of the input graph, called the 2-hop-cover labeling. This talk surveys the main characteristics of such methods, along with some recent algorithms that have been introduced to allow the usage of the 2-hop-cover technique in time-evolving scenarios, i.e. the realistic case when the managed graph undergoes topological modifications over time. We discuss empirical evidences, obtained by experimental evaluations on both real-world and synthetic inputs, that suggest that 2-hop-cover based algorithmic frameworks represent the most promising step forward towards an effective solution for mining distances in general, massive, time-evolving graphs. Most results presented in this talk, as well as most results concerning shortest-path queries in massive complex networks, are of experimental nature and have been achieved also thanks to the recent development of effective toolkits for large-scale graph processing, such as NetworKit. Only a few works with worst-case guarantees are known, and only for special cases (e.g. restrictions on the input): this represents a major open problem that deserves further investigation.</div></li>
