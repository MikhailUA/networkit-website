We are happy to announce that **NetworKit Day** will be held on **October 15,
2020** via zoom.
The goal of this day is to both present NetworKit to people who don’t know it
yet and to update more seasoned users and developers about the new
features, which have grown quite a bit over the last years. Also, in this
meeting we wish to discuss future development directions and receive feedback
on the current status of NetworKit.

Registration is mandatory to attend, so do not forget to
`register (free of charge) by October 13th
